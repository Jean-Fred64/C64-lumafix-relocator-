# C64 lumafix relocator

Another fork of lumafix  

:construction: Still WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:  

Special design for motherboard C64 with ZIF support  

The height is too high to place the VIC-II with ZIF support and the lumafix :collision: 

This version allows to move the VIC-II in a free area outside the keyboard
